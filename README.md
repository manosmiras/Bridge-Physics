# Bridge Physics
## A physics driven bridge simulation.
The purpose of this project was to develop a scene that demonstrates my understanding of physics based animation systems. I decided I was going to simulate a rope bridge, using a mass-spring system, where a collection of particles are interconnected, applying forces to each other. The user can interact with the bridge physics via a GUI or a controllable 'player' sphere.
